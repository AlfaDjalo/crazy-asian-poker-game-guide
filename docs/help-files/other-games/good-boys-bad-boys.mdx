Two standard three card flops are dealt. The top board is the "good
boys". The bottom board is the "bad boys". All cards of the same rank as
the bad boys, whether on the top board or in players hands, on the
current street and all future streets, are dead and must be discarded
immediately.

Good boys, bad boys is a hold'em style game, with the winner of the hand
going to the best hold'em hand using the "good boys" remaining at
showdown.

The winner of the pot must show their hand, even if all other players
have folded. Their hand is declared void if they hold any "bad boys".
