Ring of Fire is a single board PLO variant where each player is dealt
one extra card face up in front of them. These cards are the "ring".
When a player folds, their ring card is also folded.

To make a hand at showdown, a player must use two cards from the board,
one card from the ring, and two cards from their hand.

Ring of Fire can be played with all the usual CAP variants and features.
Other board configurations, such as a double board, can also be used.
