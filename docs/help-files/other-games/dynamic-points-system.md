This is a triple board variant. The difference is that at showdown each
player chooses which two boards they want to contest, allocating one
point to each. The best high hand on each board collects all the points
allocated to that board. A final point goes to the best hand.

After betting on the river, each player takes chips under the table.
They place chips in each hand to represent which two boards they want to
contest. For example, to play boards one and two, the player places one
chip in one hand and two in the other.

Players must select two and only two separate boards. To not do so
forfeits their hand.
