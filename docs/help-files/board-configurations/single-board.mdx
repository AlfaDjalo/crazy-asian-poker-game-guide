**Single board**

This is the standard hold'em boards, dealt in the usual manner - three
card flops for each board, a single turn card for each board, and a
single river card for each board.

Games possible using the single board configurations include:

- High only. The best high hand wins. This is the standard for no limit 
  hold'em or PLO.

- High / low split pot. The best high hand wins half the pot, the best
  low hand wins half the pot. If there is no low possible then the high
  hand wins the entire pot. This is the standard for PLO8.

- High / low / hand (3 points). The best high on the board is worth one
  point, the best low on the board is worth one point, and the best five
  card Hand Point is worth one point.
