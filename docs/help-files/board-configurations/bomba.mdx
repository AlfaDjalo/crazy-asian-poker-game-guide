**Bomba**

Three cards are dealt in a vertical line for "pre-flop".

A second three card vertical line is dealt next to the first one for the
"flop".

A third three card line is dealt next to the first two, which is the
"turn". This completes what I will refer to as the "main board".

Two "river" cards are dealt below the three vertical lines of three
cards each.

A hand is made by taking two hold cards, exactly two cards from any
single three card vertical line, and exactly one of the two river cards.

Games possible using the Bomba configurations include:

- Best high/best low (split pot). The best high wins half the pot, and
  the best low wins half the pot.

- Best high/best low/hand (3 points). The best high is worth one point,
  the best low is worth one point, and the best five card Hand Point is
  worth one point.

- Variants include dealing one of the river cards to the right of the
  main board. Hands can then also be made by taking two hold cards,
  exactly two cards from any single row, and the horizontal river card.
  Note that in this case vertical hands must use the vertical river
  card. This allows the game to be played three points (high/high/hand)
  or five points (high/low/high/low/hand).
