Four cards are dealt at the vertices of a 3x3 square for the flop.

The edges of the square are dealt on the turn.

The second bullseye, which is dealt separately to the main board, can be
dealt on the turn after the edges, or as the second card on the river.

The main bullseye, which is the centre of the square, is dealt on the
river.

Points are for the best make-5 hand on the main board using any row,
column or diagonal. Bullseye points can use either or both of the
bullseye cards.
