**Funnel**

Three flops are dealt, each with three cards.

Two turns are dealt, each with two cards.

One river is dealt with one card.

To make a hand a player uses cards from one flop, one turn and the
river. The turn must make a path from the flop to the turn - ie. if
using flop 1, a player can only use turn 1. If using flop 2, a player
can use either turn. If using flop 3, a player must use turn 2.

Variants of Funnel include:

- High/ low (split pot);

- High/low/hand (3 points).

There are also variants using different numbers of turn and river cards.
