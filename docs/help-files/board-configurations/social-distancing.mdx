*Social Distancing**

In the original Social Distancing game, four cards were dealt
horizontally left to right on the flop; two turn cards were dealt
horizontally to the right of the flop; and two river cards were dealt
horizontally to right of the turn. The final board is therefore an eight
card line.

Players must make an Omaha-style hand using non-adjacent cards.

Games possible using the Social Distancing configuration include:

- High only;

- High/ low (split pot);

- High/low/hand (3 points).

Note that all variants use social distancing for both high and low. A
common variant is to deal five cards on the flop, making the final board
a nine card line. This variant allows a made hand on the flop.
