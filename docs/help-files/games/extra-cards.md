**_Extra cards_**

A number of Extra Card options have been used in CAP.

**ESG**

ESG refers to the recycling of discards. When the number of cards in the
discard pile is greater than or equal to the number of players remaining
in the hand, players receive one extra hold card for the next street.
This is the default in some CAP games.

In some cases, cards that will be undealt after the river are added to
the discard pile to increase the likelihood of ESG.

**Catchup ESG**

Similar to ESG, however if ESG is missed on a street it is "caught up"
on the first future street where there are sufficient discard cards.

**Christmas**

When the number of cards remaining in the deck is greater than or equal
to the number of board cards still required to be dealt plus the number
of players remaining in the hand, players receive one extra hold card
for the next street.

**Grinch**

The player taking the last aggressive action decides whether or not
there will be a Christmas on the next street.

**Pass the Trash**

Players select a specified number of cards from their hand, and pass
these to another player specified.

This may happen just pre-flop, or also post-flop.

**Draw**

Players can choose to discard any number of cards from their hand, and
draw the same number of cards from the deck.

**Discard**

Players must discard a set number of cards from their hand.

This may happen just pre-flop, or also post-flop.
