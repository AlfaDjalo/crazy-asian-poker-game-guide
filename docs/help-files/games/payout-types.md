Games usually consist of multiple components. There are two main ways to
determine payouts based on the component results:

- Split pot. The pot is split evenly between the winners of the
  individual components.

- Points. Each component has a given number of points, and the player
  with the most points wins the pot. If multiple players have the same
  number of points the pot is chopped.
