**Blinds**

Most CAP games use the standard small blind/big blind structure of
hold'em and Omaha. A UTG straddle is allowed but not mandatory, as are
double/triple/etc. straddles.

**Antes**

Antes are allowed but are uncommon. Similarly for bomb pots. The size of
straddles, antes and bomb pots is generally referenced off the standard
blind structure.

**Betting Limits**

Most games are played pot limit. Hold'em-style games are usually played
no limit. Fixed limit games are strongly discouraged.

**Buying Cards**

In some games, players are required to pay a fixed amount for an
optional extra card on a street. The fixed amount may increase with each
street.
