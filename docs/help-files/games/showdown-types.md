**_Showdown types_**

There are three showdown types used in CAP:

- Omaha-style. Must use two hold cards and three board cards.

- Make-5. Must use all cards on a board and enough hold cards to make a
  five-card hand.

- Hold'em style. Can use any number of hold cards and board cards. This
  is the least common showdown type in CAP.

Note that board in this case refers to the board cards that can be used
to make a particular point.
