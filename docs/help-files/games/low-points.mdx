There are a number of ways in which the best low hand can be determined:

- Traditional 8-or-better qualifying low. Ace is the lowest card,
  straights and flushes do not matter.

- 7-2 low. This is an unqualified low. Ace plays high. Straights and
  flushes impact hand rankings. Hand ranking is the reverse of standard
  high hand ranking.

- 6-2 low. This is an unqualified low. Ace plays high. Straights and
  flushes do not matter.

- Badugi. This is an unqualified low using up to four cards. This low
  can use at most one card from each suit and one card of each rank.

- Least suits. This can be any of the first three low types
  (traditional, 7-2 or 6-2), but when the best low is held my more than
  one player, the hand with the least number of suits wins the hand. If
  more than one player has the same number of suits with the lowest
  hand, the point is chopped between them.
