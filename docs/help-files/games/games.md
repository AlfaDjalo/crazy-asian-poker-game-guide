**Chapter 2: Games**

There are many different games played in CAP. Players are encouraged to
innovate.

When designing new games, the following principles generally apply:

- Must be playable with a single complete 52 card deck.

- Games you can play online are not allowed.

- Encourages action. This can be achieved by keeping equities close, and
  encouraging betting.

- Try not to make things too complicated.

It is often an objective to use as many cards from the deck as possible.
This is usually achieved by dealing out as many hold cards preflop as
the deck and game structure will allow.
