**_Point Types_**

Points can be divided along two dimensions -- board point vs hand point,
and high point vs low point. It is much more common for hand points to
be high points than low points.

**Board points**

These are points made using the specified board cards. Any of the
showdown types might apply.

**Hand points**

These are points made using the players hold cards. These are usually,
but not always, five card hands.

**High points**

These points are awarded to the best traditional high hand, either on a
board or in the player's hand.

In some games, notably allocation games, a point is awarded to the best
high hand using less than five cards. Straights and flushes may or may
not be allowed.

**Low points**

These points are awarded to the best low hand, either on a board or in
the player's hand. There are a number of ways in which the best low hand
can be determined:

- Traditional 8-or-better qualifying low. Ace is the lowest card,
  straights and flushes do not matter.

- 7-2 low. This is an unqualified low. Ace plays high. Straights and
  flushes impact hand rankings. Hand ranking is the reverse of standard
  high hand ranking.

- 6-2 low. This is an unqualified low. Ace plays high. Straights and
  flushes do not matter.

- Badugi. This is an unqualified low using up to four cards. This low
  can use at most one card from each suit and one card of each rank.

- Least suits. This can be any of the first three low types
  (traditional, 7-2 or 6-2), but when the best low is held my more than
  one player, the hand with the least number of suits wins the hand. If
  more than one player has the same number of suits with the lowest
  hand, the point is chopped between them.
