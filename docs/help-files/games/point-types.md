**_Point Types_**

Points can be divided along two dimensions -- board point vs hand point,
and high point vs low point. It is much more common for hand points to
be high points than low points.

**Board points**

These are points made using the specified board cards. Any of the
showdown types might apply.

**Hand points**

These are points made using the players hold cards. These are usually,
but not always, five card hands.

**High points**

These points are awarded to the best traditional high hand, either on a
board or in the player's hand.

In some games, notably allocation games, a point is awarded to the best
high hand using less than five cards. Straights and flushes may or may
not be allowed.

**Low points**

These points are awarded to the best low hand, either on a board or in
the player's hand.
