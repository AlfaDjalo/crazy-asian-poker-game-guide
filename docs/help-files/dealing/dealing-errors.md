For common dealing errors, standard practices should apply. The
following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to
the error before two players have acted on their hands. (If two players
have acted in turn, the deal must be played to conclusion)

a.  The first or second card of the hand has been dealt faceup or
    exposed through dealer error.

b.  Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer.

c.  Two or more boxed cards (improperly faced cards) are found.

d.  Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a
    game.

e.  An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the
    top card may be dealt if it goes to the player in proper sequence.

f.  Any card has been dealt out of the proper sequence.

g.  The button was out of position.

h.  The first card was dealt to the wrong position.

i.  Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a
    hand.

j.  A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player
    must be present at the table or have posted a blind or ante.

Action is considered to occur when two players after the blinds have
acted on their hands. Once action occurs, a misdeal can no longer be
declared. The hand will be played to conclusion and no money will be
returned to any player whose hand is fouled.

Some general principles are applied to keep the game running smoothly.

- The response to misdeals is determined by consensus of the players at
  the table. A suitable amount of time should be taken to discuss the
  situation, as the solution sets a precedent for similar situations in
  future.

- Players with a conflict of interest (such as players directly involved
  in the hand, or those with a business or romantic relationship with a
  player in the hand) can provide input into discussion but should
  generally be excluded from making the final decision on the resolution
  of the issue.

- The host has the final say.

The standard responses to some of the more common CAP dealing errors
are:

**Too many cards dealt per player.**

If no player has looked at their cards, the top card(s) for each player
is taken back so that each player has the correct number of cards.

If any player has looked at their cards, a misdeal is called and the
hand must be redealt.

If at any point during the hand a player is found to have more cards
than they should, their hand will be declared dead.

**Exposed cards.**

Exposed cards will be shown to the table, then shuffled back into the
remaining deck. If the impact of having a known card in the remaining
deck is considered to be too great by the player group, further betting
in the hand will cease and the hand will be dealt to showdown. If
necessary, any bets on the current street will be returned.

**Incorrectly dealt ESG.**

In the event ESG cards have been incorrectly dealt to players

- If no player has looked at the ESG card then the cards will be
  returned to the discard pile.

- If one or more players has seen the ESG card, if all players have
  received the extra card then players will keep the extra card, and
  players will not receive that ESG card on the next street.

- If only a small number of players have received the extra card, then
  if the extra ESG cards can be reliably identified they will be
  shuffled back into the ESG deck. Alternatively, if there are enough
  cards available then the extra ESG card can be dealt to all eligible
  players.
