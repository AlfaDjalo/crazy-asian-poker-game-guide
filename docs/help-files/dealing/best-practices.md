To minimise potential errors and keep the game moving smoothly, a number
of "best practices" have developed for the dealing functions.

**Burn cards.**

By default, there are no burn cards. This allows more of the deck to be
used in the game.

**Order of boards.**

Where there are multiple boards, the dealer deals the board furthest
away first. This is referred to as the top board. At showdown, the
points for this board are calculated first.

When there are three boards the dealer deals the middle board next,
below the top board. Points for this board are calculated second at
showdown.

The board closest the dealer is dealt last, referred to as the bottom
board. Points for this board are calculated after the other boards, but
before any hand points are calculated.

In high/low games, the high point for a board is calculated before the
low point.

Standard conventions have also been developed for other games:

- For Bomba, boards are dealt left to right.

- For Double Bullseye, at showdown points for the main board are
  calculated before the points for the bullseyes.

**Chopping pots.**

Standard rules for chopped pots are applied where possible.

When the pot must be chopped into uneven stacks (eg. When the pot is not
a multiple of the number of players) the extra chips are distributed to
players based on distance from the dealer.

Pots should be chopped cleanly and removed from the playing area before
the next hand proceeds.

**Other**

Players are responsible for ensuring that they receive the correct
amount.

The dealer should place the button on top of the live deck, to protect
the deck and differentiate the deck from their own hand.
